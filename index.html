       Hair strands found at a crime scene can often provide clues for investigators. Although hair analysis cannot pinpoint a suspect with 100% certainty, it can help eliminate persons of interest and provide clues as to who might have been present at the scene of a crime. At the microscopic level, hair can provide information about the owner’s characteristics such as race, sex, and possibly age. When forensic scientists collect hair from the scene of the crime, it is analyzed to determine its origin (human versus animal) and then compared to the hair of the suspect(s) and victim(s). To better understand what you are looking at when you view the hair samples under the microscope, let’s take a deeper look at the structure of hair. Hair is composed of a protein called keratin. Keratin is the same protein that forms our nails and our outer layer of skin. Hair shafts are composed of three layers: the cuticle, the cortex, and the medulla.

   When experts compare two fingerprints, they look at the arrangement, shape, size, and number of lines in the fingerprint patterns to distinguish one from another. They also analyze very tiny characteristics called minutiae, tiny fingerprint ridge details and make sure to match at least 12-15 points of similarity between the two prints to establish that they are identical. When two fingerprints show similarities with at least 12 minutiae, it is called a 12 Point Match, something you may have heard on your favorite crime scene show. Below are the ten most frequent minutiae, with the ending ridge being the most frequent and the triple fork being the least frequent.
